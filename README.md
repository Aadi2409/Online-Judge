# Online-Judge
A full-stack competitive programming platform — built from scratch using the MERN stack with Docker-sandboxed code execution, JWT authentication, and an async submission pipeline.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

Online Judge is a platform that hosts coding competitions where participants submit solutions that are automatically evaluated against hidden test cases.

This project replicates core features of platforms like **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, and **LeetCode**.

The system handles real-world engineering challenges:

* **Thundering Herd** → thousands of simultaneous submissions handled using async queues
* **Malicious Code Execution** → sandboxed inside Docker containers
* **Verdict Integrity** → protected using JWT authentication and RBAC
* **Scalability** → asynchronous workers and distributed evaluation pipelines
